## Games

### Coin Dash

Coin Dash is a fast-paced game where the player needs to collect as many coins as possible before the timer runs out. The player must tap the screen to make the character move and collect coins, while avoiding obstacles.

### Degen Coin Flip

Degen Coin Flip is a playful twist on the popular staking game. The player can choose to bet on either "heads" or "tails" and witness a Flow-themed coin flip. The game adds a fun and parody element to the traditional coin flip concept.

## The Problem it Solves

Flow-Arcade addresses the growing demand for engaging and decentralized gaming experiences. It leverages the power of the Flow blockchain and React Native to provide a platform where users can enjoy fun and interactive games with a touch of blockchain technology. By combining the benefits of blockchain, such as transparency, security, and ownership of in-game assets, Flow-Arcade offers a unique gaming experience for players.

## Challenges We Ran Into:

During the development of Flow-Arcade, we encountered several challenges. Some of the notable ones include:

1. **Integrating the Flow blockchain**:  
   Incorporating the Flow blockchain into the game platform required extensive research and understanding of blockchain concepts. We had to navigate through the complexities of working with blockchain infrastructure, including wallet integration, transaction management, and smart contract interactions.

2. **Game Design and Development**:  
   Creating engaging and addictive games that seamlessly integrate with the Flow blockchain posed its own set of challenges. We had to ensure smooth gameplay, intuitive controls, and appealing visual aesthetics while integrating blockchain functionality such as asset ownership and in-game rewards.

## Dependencies

Flow-Arcade relies on the following dependencies:

- **fcl-react-native**: A library that facilitates the integration of Flow blockchain functionalities into React Native applications. It simplifies wallet management, transaction handling, and blockchain interactions.

- **React Native**: A popular JavaScript framework for building mobile applications. It allows us to develop cross-platform games with a native-like experience.

- **Expo**: A framework and platform for developing and testing React Native applications. It simplifies the development process and offers various tools and services.

- Other dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.
